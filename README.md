This project explores the Palmer Penguins dataset using R and the tidyverse package to perform data cleaning, summarization, and visualization. The analysis aims to uncover insights into different penguin species â€” such as variations in body mass, flipper length, and other physical characteristics.

The project includes:

Data preprocessing with dplyr

Summary statistics and grouping by species

Visualizations using ggplot2 (scatter plots, boxplots)

A final PDF report generated from R Markdown

Languages & Tools: R, R Markdown, tidyverse, ggplot2
